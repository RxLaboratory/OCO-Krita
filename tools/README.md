# Development tools

## development_setup.bat

Run this script on Windows to quickly setup your dev environment with Krita. It symlinks the plugin files into Krita's plugin directory.

1. Edit the file to set the variables: path to Krita's resources and path to the DuKRIF repo which you need to clone too, and finally the path to the OCO python module.
2. Run the script. It will ask for admin privileges, needed to write symlinks.
3. Start Krita, activate the plugin
4. Restart Krita
